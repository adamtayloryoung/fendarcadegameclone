# UDACITY PROJECT 3 ARCADE GAME CLONE
This is project #3 for the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree. The objective of this project was to create a clone of the arcade game 'Frogger' in order to apply recently studied concepts of Object-Oriented-Programming. We were provided with a fully fleshed out resources.js and a developed engine.js file which required some small modifications in order to get the project working. I completed the basic requirements of the rubric and made a few modifications to play style and visual assets. In my version you are a knight, your objective is to capture the trophy, and your enemies are gelatinous cubes which block the road. If you are hit by a cube, you return to your start position. If you capture the trophy, you will recieve an alert informing you that you've won the game.
